Hi, I’m L.G.Raga!
I am a highly motivated Data Science student currently pursuing a Master’s degree at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY. With a solid foundation in mechanical engineering and a deep interest in machine learning, I have built a strong understanding of neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and data-driven solutions. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Java, and I leverage these skills to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions.
